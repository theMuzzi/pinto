Pinto is a service similar to Parsec which is designed as an application to allow users to connect to a host's PC and control designated inputs on a computer chosen by the host. All who connect will have the same inputs. It is inspired by Jackbox Games' party games, as well as DougDoug's Twitch chat plays series.
